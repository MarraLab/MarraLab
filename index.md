# Multiomic Analysis of Treatment Resistance and Cancer Heterogeneity (**MATCH**) Lab

**Our Vision**

The MATCH Lab is composed of students, post-doctoral fellows, biologists and informaticians who are collectively motivated by a vision in which the power of genome analysis is leveraged to identify cancer cell vulnerabilities that can be actioned to improve outcomes for cancer patients. We intend to identify and rationalize therapeutic targets and transmit this information into research and health care settings at scale, thereby influencing treatment planning and improving outcomes for the benefit of cancer patients, their loved ones and society as a whole.

**Research Area:**

The MATCH lab has positioned itself as a nexus of technology development, cancer genome science and personalized cancer genomic medicine to deliver new discoveries capable of shifting cancer research and treatment paradigms and revealing new, more effective ways to treat cancer. We do this by engaging in research projects that have the potential to influence clinical paradigms and eventually lead to the creation of new treatment options for cancer patients. 

## Example Research Projects:

1. Single-cell Multi-omic Analyses To Identify And Characterize Cell Populations In Patients With Primary And Relapsed Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
2. Single-cell multi-omics analysis of primary/recurrent GBM pairs and matched organoid models to investigate mechanisms of treatment resistance.
3. HPV- and EBV-associated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic dysregulation in cancer.
4. Effect of HPV integration on 3D genome structure and function in cervical cancer.
5. Pan-cancer analysis of extrachromosomal DNA structure and regulation.
6. The Personalized Approaches in the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancers (PATH) study.
7. Single nucleus multi-omics for precision cancer genomic medicine.
