## Example Research Projects:

1. Single-cell Multi-omic Analyses To Identify And Characterize Cell Populations In Patients With Primary And Relapsed Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
2. Single-cell multi-omics analysis of primary/recurrent GBM pairs and matched organoid models to investigate mechanisms of treatment resistance.
3. HPV- and EBV-associated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic dysregulation in cancer.
4. Effect of HPV integration on 3D genome structure and function in cervical cancer.
5. Pan-cancer analysis of extrachromosomal DNA structure and regulation.
6. The Personalized Approaches in the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancers (PATH) study.
7. Single nucleus multi-omics for precision cancer genomic medicine.
