Graduate students in the MATCH lab are a part of the [UBC Bioinformatics Training Program](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-bioinformatics), [UBC Genome Sciences and Technology Program (GSAT)](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-genome-science-technology), and the [UBC Medical Genetics Program](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-medical-genetics). Trainees and research staff work on a wide range of projects from characterizing cancer driver mutations and other alterations relevant to cancer to projects designed to identify and study critical cancer genes and pathways.

We welcome inquires from prospective trainees who have demonstrated outstanding academic history and motivation for research. Please email Dr. Marra for potential opportunities.
