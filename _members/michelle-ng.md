**Hometown:** Vancouver, BC, Canada


**Academic & professional history**

Dr. Michelle Ng (she/her) has worked in cancer research since her first undergraduate Co-op internship at UBC. Her PhD, which she completed in Germany, focused on the role of long noncoding RNAs in acute myeloid leukemia pathobiology. Michelle joined the MATCH lab as a postdoc in 2022.

**What project(s) do you work on?**

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative of cervical cancer. In over 80% of cases, parts of the HPV genome become integrated into the host cell genome, causing structural variation and epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation of both the viral and host genomes. Michelle aims to understand how HPV integration affects the 3D folding of the genome, and how this may relate to other forms of dysregulation caused by HPV. By integrating various data types, she hopes to explore how the multi-omic consequences of viral integration may be informed and/or constrained by 3D genome architecture, and how certain features may become dysregulated and contribute to cancer pathogenesis.


**How do you spend your time outside of the lab?**

Outside of the lab, Michelle is an avid dancer and reader. She also sometimes sings, skates, and sketches.
