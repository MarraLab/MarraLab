**Hometown:** Victoria, BC, Canada


**Academic & professional history**
During my PhD, I studied normal T-cell differentiation to gain insights into T-cell leukemia pathogenesis. I then transitioned to a role as a Computational Biologist, where I focused on chromatin accessibility changes linked to immune cell activation.


**What project are you working on?**
KMT2A-rearranged pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (KMT2A-r pAML) presents significant clinical challenges. Over 80 rearrangement partners have been documented, and this molecular diversity contributes to a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes. The mechanisms that shape treatment response across different rearrangement partner subgroups require further investigation. This project aims to define how rearrangement partners impact treatment outcomes by profiling single-cell transcriptomes and epigenomes at both diagnosis and relapse. By identifying molecular dependencies linked to poor treatment response across different rearrangement partners, we aim to reveal actionable targets to guide the development of more effective, personalized therapies.

**How do you spend your time outside of the lab?**
Outside of the lab I am typically hiking, running, or making a video game!
