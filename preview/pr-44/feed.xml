<p>The MATCH lab is thrilled to share new from Ottawa that Dr Marco A Marra O.C., O.B.C., has been made one of the 88 new appointments to the Order of Canada, including one Companion, 24 Officers and 63 Members. Three appointments are promotions within the Order.</p>

<p>The Order of Canada is the cornerstone of the Canadian Honours System and is one of Canada’s highest honours. It recognizes people across all sectors of society who have made extraordinary and sustained contributions to our nation.</p>

<p>Dr Marra was recognized for his contribution to propel Canada to the forefront of genome research. A world-renowned scientist, he led large-scale initiatives and groundbreaking work in sequencing the SARS coronavirus genome, and highlighted the underlying causes of cancers and new treatment strategies. Formerly director of Canada’s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, he continues the global fight against cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01851-2">The correlation between CpG methylation and gene expression is driven by sequence variants</a></p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olafur Andri Stefansson, et al.</p>

<p><strong>Journal:</strong> Nature Genetics</p>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> August 2024</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Gene promoter and enhancer sequences are bound by transcription factors and are depleted of methylated CpG sites (cytosines preceding guanines in DNA). The absence of methylated CpGs in these sequences typically correlates with increased gene expression, indicating a regulatory role for methylation. We used nanopore sequencing to determine haplotype-specific methylation rates of 15.3 million CpG units in 7,179 whole-blood genomes. We identified 189,178 methylation depleted sequences where three or more proximal CpGs were unmethylated on at least one haplotype. A total of 77,789 methylation depleted sequences (~41%) associated with 80,503 cis-acting sequence variants, which we termed allele-specific methylation quantitative trait loci (ASM-QTLs). RNA sequencing of 896 samples from the same blood draws used to perform nanopore sequencing showed that the ASM-QTL, that is, DNA sequence variability, drives most of the correlation found between gene expression and CpG methylation. ASM-QTLs were enriched 40.2-fold (95% confidence interval 32.2, 49.9) among sequence variants associating with hematological traits, demonstrating that ASM-QTLs are important functional units in the noncoding genome.</p>]]></content><author><name>signe-maclennan</name></author><category term="DNA sequencing" /><category term="Epigenetics" /><category term="Gene expression" /><category term="Genome-wide association studies" /><category term="Genomics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Presented by Signe Title: The correlation between CpG methylation and gene expression is driven by sequence variants]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Journal Club 1</title><link href="/marralab/preview/pr-44/2024/05/29/journal-club-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Journal Club 1" /><published>2024-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-18T16:42:45+00:00</updated><id>/marralab/preview/pr-44/2024/05/29/journal-club-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="/marralab/preview/pr-44/2024/05/29/journal-club-1.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="presented-by-hayley-steif-lab">Presented by Hayley (Steif Lab)</h2>
