**Title:** [Quiescent cancer cells resist T cell attack by forming an immunosuppressive niche](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.03.033)

**Authors:** Pilar Baldominos, et al. 

**Journal:** Cell

**Year:** 2022

**Highlights:**

- Antigen-expressing tumor cells that escape from T cell attack are quiescent.
- Quiescent cancer cells (QCCs) form clusters that exclude immune infiltrates.
- PADME-seq reveals an increase in terminally exhausted T cells in the QCC niche.
- HIF1a activation in cancer cells augments T cell exhaustion and reduces T cell killing.
